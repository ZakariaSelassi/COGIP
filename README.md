# Mission:
The COGIP is a company which we don't know an all lot about apart that they produce <a href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3a51">Jean-Michel toys</a> and that they are serious workers <a href ="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x68i87">check</a>. They also have incredible <a href ="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/xabck6">employees</a> within their rank.

Jean-Christian Ranu works in accounting at the COGIP. He has been using an old, ugly and incomplete software for years, making him go between it and excels sheet. Jean-Christian like paella, crosswords and his coworker Muriel Perrache.

We propose that you code a web application which will respond to the needs and desire of Jean-Christian.

NOTE: Don't forget to add an SQL file containing the structure in the repository, as well as, an entry within the README detailing what each person did.

## Tips
* Think about your strategy! What are you going to start with? The database? The SQL request? The connexion to the database? The design? You should all agree on the procedure.
* You should all do some CRUD, you're 3 and there is 3 types of documents to process (invoice, companies, people), just saying.
* You should all read the briefing, there are certainly informations you won't have picked on your own and if it's still unclear, ask the client (coaches). Understanding the vision of the client is also a big part of development.
* Communication is important! Between the members of the group, with the client and even with other member of your startup.

! ### <summary> Instructions </summary>

### Data needed by Jean-Christian 

#### Tables

Some information must be into the database an *it is not negotiable*: the data relating to people, companies and invoices. All this divided into four tables.

For the people, we will need:

- Their first name
- Their last name
- Their email
- For companies, we will need:

Name of the company
- Its country
- VAT number
- For invoices, we will need:

Number of the invoice
Date of the invoice
For the type of company:

The type (either client or provider)
NOTE: For clarity sake, a company of type client would buy something from the COGIP, we'll send them an invoice, while a provider company is one the COGIP buys stuff from (products or services).

#### Relations
The relations between the table would be as follow:

* Company --- type
* Company --- invoice
* People --- invoice
* People --- company

###  The application

#### Welcome page

### The welcome page should display:

- A welcome message for Jean-Christian Ranu (if logged in)
- The list of the last 5 invoices, ordered by date
- The list of the last 5 people encoded in the database
- The list of the last 5 companies encoded in the database
- A link to the providers page
- A link to the client page

### Providers page

## Administration part for Ranu

### Informations

Make it so the parameter in the URL are not the same as the name of the PHP file.

For example: imagine a website with an URL to modify a recipe which would be recettes.com/?modifplat=17 but which would actually call a file named updaterecipe.php.

### What does Ranu need ?

Once you have done the consultation part of the accounting database for Jean-Christian, you will have to create an interface of administration from which he'll be able to input, modify and delete data.

He will need a dashboard in which he will have a direct access to the:

- Five last invoices (number invoice, date, company), by clicking the invoice number or the company, he will be able to edit them.
- Five last companies (company name, its type), by clicking the invoice the company name, he will be able to edit them.
- Five last contact (first and last name, email, company name), by clicking the contact name, the invoice number or the company name, he will be able to edit them.

On the same line as each element there should also be an bin icon to delete it.

With the help of button there should also be quick access to:

- New invoice
- New contact
- New company

There must also be a custom message on the welcome page depending if Muriel or Jean-christian is connected.

If the user *as god mode* access (by default: Jean-Christian as it, his password is his last name) he will also have access to a button to manage the users. This button will lead him to a dashboard showing the members (users who have an access to the application), their access right and the power to modify them.

If the user as moderator access (by default: Muriel, her password is her last name) he will have access to the admin dashboard, he can add invoices, companies and people but can't either modify or delete elements from the database.

## Still unclear ?

This <a href="https://github.com/becodeorg/CRL-Woods-4.27/blob/main/LearningPath/03.The-Mountain/09.PHP/PHP-Challenge/cogip/mockup.md">link</a> file resumes (with an ugly design) the pages and what they should contain.

## Optional

Realise a nice and modern design for our friend Jean-Christian. Let's not forget that he as been in accounting at the COGIP for more than 20 years! It's high time to change his habits and make him enter the 21st century.

NOTE: It is imperative however that the slogan of the COGIP (vive la COGIP!) be in the footer.
